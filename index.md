Can Large Language Models (LLMs) understand concepts? The following is an attempt to draw analogies between Gender, Race and Caste and study the concept: Negative Feedback Loops.

PROMPT

Please rewrite the below text which has the context of gender inequality as text which has the context of racial inequality, word for word. Draw analogies where required.

" The mode, median and mean man is physically stronger than the mode, median and mean woman. But are Men and Women equally intelligent? 
- For every 40 Men, 1 woman has been awarded the Nobel Prize.
- The current top 100 rated chess players are all Men.
Is the answer certainly Men?
 
RESPONSE

*The mode, median, and mean white individual are more economically privileged than the mode, median, and mean person of color. But are white and people of color equally intelligent?
- For every 40 white individuals, only 1 person of color has been awarded the Nobel Prize.
- The current top 100 rated CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are all white individuals.
Is the answer definitely white individuals?
In both contexts of gender inequality and racial inequality, we observe disparities in opportunities and outcomes. These examples highlight how systemic biases can lead to significant imbalances in recognition and representation, raising important questions about fairness and equal opportunities for all.*

This topic has been discussed on the Chess.com forum since 2011. https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/why-do-we-have-woman-categories . The consensus on the forum is that 'women can't play chess lol' and 'girly chess is boring'. 
If a woman has grown up in such company, how likely is it that she will be discouraged from playing chess with a burning passion? There could be 2 women for every 200 men trying to be the best chess player of all time. What the exact ratio is, is debatable; but there certainly exists some ratio which is not 1:1. 
Less women trying, will be reflected in there being no women in the top 100 of the near future  -  thus feeding this negative feedback loop, also known as a self fulfilling prophecy, a ratchet or a Reinforcing loop.

If a person of color has grown up in such company, how likely is it that they will be discouraged from playing chess with a burning passion? There could be 2 people of color for every 200 white individuals trying to be the best chess player of all time. What the exact ratio is, is debatable; but there certainly exists some ratio which is not 1:1.
Fewer people of color trying will be reflected in there being no people of color in the top 100 of the near future - thus feeding this negative feedback loop, also known as a self-fulfilling prophecy, a ratchet, or a reinforcing loop.*

*In this revised text, we've replaced the context of gender inequality with racial inequality, specifically focusing on the representation and perception of people of color in the game of chess. The analogies draw attention to how biases and stereotypes can discourage individuals from marginalized groups from pursuing their interests and passions, leading to disparities in representation at higher levels.*

Escaping these loops is difficult. Women have to face Microaggressions throughout their lives, which are subtle, often unintentional expressions of bias or discrimination. Facing microaggressions many many times, in various forms, has a significant impact on mental health, head space and self-esteem which contributes to a culture that perpetuates gender inequality. 
Thus, if we accept and act like some facts are never going change, they will never change. What has been true in our primal past, will continue to do so in our future.

*In this version, we've replaced the context of gender inequality with racial inequality, highlighting the persistent challenges faced by people of color due to microaggressions and how they contribute to the perpetuation of racial disparities. The analogy draws a parallel between the impact of microaggressions on women's experiences and how the same phenomenon affects people of color in the context of racial inequality. The closing statement emphasizes the importance of challenging and changing the status quo to break the cycle of inequality.*

Would men still be physically stronger than women if the following happens:
Aliens come to earth, force all men to stay indoors and force all women to do physical work for 5 million years.

RESPONSE

*Would white individuals still be economically privileged compared to people of color if the following happens:
Aliens come to earth, force all white individuals to stay indoors, and force all people of color to do highly demanding and low-paying work for 5 million years.*
*
In this version, we've replaced the context of gender inequality with racial inequality, drawing an analogy to the physical strength comparison in the original text. The scenario now focuses on economic privilege, where white individuals are considered to have greater advantages than people of color in the context of the hypothetical alien intervention.*
